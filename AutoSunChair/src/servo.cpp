/* Servo SG90 requires a pwm signal, +5V VCC, and ground connection

    PWM signal:
        50Hz (20ms) period, ~5V amplitude, 1-2 ms Duty Cycle (10%-20%)


        When the duty cycle is 1ms, servo at 0 degrees
                               1.5,         90
                                2           180
