/* PWM 
    1.Uses a PWMs on timer 3 and timer 4.
        - Physical header pins 5 and 6 should be used. Pin 5 relates
            to timer 3 and pin 6 relates to timer 4.
        - Note:  You will need to demo your PWM signal coming from
            timer 3 using the digital storage oscilloscope in the lab.
    

    2.Has a changeDutyCycle function.
        - the changeDutyCycle function takes in an argument which is the
            combination of the analog to digital conversion, ADCH and ADCL
            registers. The result of the combination of the ADCH and ADCL
            registers is a 10-bit number. From this you will edit the OCRnA
            registers for the two 10-bit PWM timers used for the lab. Editing
            the OCRnA register changes the duty cycle of the PWM signal.
